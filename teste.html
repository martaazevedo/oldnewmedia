        <p class="intro">In the last 50 years, the Internet has evolved more rapidly than ever imagined.

The system uses a set of ninety-four criteria, all of which are allegedly signs of stress, fear, or deception. But looking for these responses meant that some groups are immediately disadvantaged. Anyone who was stressed, was uncomfortable under questioning, or had had negative experiences with police and border guards could score higher. This produced its own forms of racial profilling. »
